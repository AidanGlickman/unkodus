# Equiv Method

This folder contains code for generating puzzles using the `equiv` and `sudoku2` binaries from Bertram Felgenhauer.

To use it, first compile the binaries in `original_code` with `make`. Note that this code uses some weird inlined assembly that only works using the `icc` compiler. You can get `icc` [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/intel-system-studio-download-and-install-intel-c-compiler.html)
